            <span class="label label-default">Aug 03 2016</span> Release of ObsPy 1.0.2
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                This is the second bug fix release in the 1.0 release cycle. It does not change functionality/API but fixes
                quite a
                number of bugs resulting in an overall more stable ObsPy package.
            </p>
            <p>
                We recommend all users to upgrade through one of the usual channels. Please see the full changelog for all

        </dt>

        <dd>
            <p>
                This is the first bug fix release in the 1.0 release cycle. It does not change functionality/API but fixes
                several bugs in
                1.0.0, most notably fixing decryption of encrypted data from requests on restricted data via ArcLink and some
                bugs when
                working with SAC headers in the rewritten SAC module.

                This is a big release with significant internal changes, new features, stability improvements, and
                much more to prepare ObsPy for future challenges and get rid of accumulated technical debt. It is now
                stable enough to officially declare it version 1.0. Changes are broad and numerous - follow these links to

            <p>
                ObsPy 0.10.1 is once again our biggest release yet with over 2200 single commits from 25 individual
